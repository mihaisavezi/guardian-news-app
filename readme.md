## Exercise
The assignment is to create a single-page application that displays the latest news from around the
world. You must use the API from The Guardian described at http://openplatform.theguardian.com/documentation.
The API exposes an endpoint that lists news based on search
queries or predefined topics. Follow the description available at the provided URL to see the structure of
the requests.

## Acceptance Criteria
Your application must implement the following requirements:

- Each story result must be displayed in a separate section (the meaning of “section” is up to you,
i.e. there could be an accordion control holding all stories, or each story could occupy the entire
viewport)

- Accessing a story must insert an entry into the browser’s history so that the user is able to use
the Back and Forward buttons to navigate through the browsing history inside the application

- The stories in a page must each display their title, section name, the full link to the story and the
date the story.
- The page containing the stories should have pagination
