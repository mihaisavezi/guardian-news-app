- run `npm install` first to install dependencies
- The app tries as much as possible to adhere to [Best Practice Recommendations for Angular App Structure](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XXMvReO8-Awi1EZXAXS4PzDzdNvV6pGcuaF4Q9821Es/pub).
- Since it uses es6 wherever possible some hints are taken from [another Angular Styleguide](https://github.com/toddmotto/angular-styleguide) made for es6.

#### For the build use NPM scripts

- `npm run build` to build an optimized version of your application in /dist
- `npm run serve` to launch a browser sync server on your source files
- `npm run serve:dist` to launch a server on your optimized application
- `npm run test` to launch your unit tests with Karma
- `npm run test:auto` to launch your unit tests with Karma in watch mode


#### Or Gulp tasks

If you have [`gulp-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-cli) installed in global packages you can use equivalent:

- `gulp` or `gulp build`
- `gulp serve`
- `gulp serve:dist`
- `gulp test`
- `gulp test:auto`
